[![Support Toolkit](stk/images/support_toolkit_logo_large.png)](https://github.com/wintstar/support-toolkit/ "Support Toolkit")

The Support Toolkit (STK) provides a second "Administration Control Panel" that can be used to recover various part of a corrupted phpBB 3.1.x installation or to solve commonly encountered problems with the software

STK (Support Toolkit) is based on the development of the phpBB Team, AlexSheer phpbb3.1-STK & phpBB3.2-STK, Tatiana5 phpBB3.2-STK. German translation based on [Mahony](http://phpbb3-support.square7.ch/viewtopic.php?p=5058 "STK für phpBB3.3.14")

**Installation**  
Create a folder with the name stk in the root directory of the board (where the config.php file is located) and copy all files from the support-toolkit folder, retaining the folder structure.

Then call up https://own_domain.com/forum/stk/ in the browser.

**Update**  
Completely delete the folder with the name stk in the root directory of the board (where the config.php file is located) and then continue as described above under ‘Installation’.

**Support Toolkit is in ‘development’ status and is not an official tool of phpBB. Some functions may be faulty. Before each use, make a backup of the forum directory and create a database backup !!!**.
**The author assumes no liability**
